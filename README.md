***What is Unit Testing?***

Unit Testing is the first level of software testing where the smallest testable parts of a software are tested. This is used to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed.
The unittest test framework is python’s xUnit style framework.

***Method:***

White Box Testing method is used for Unit testing.

***OOP concepts supported by unittest framework:***

***. test fixture:***

A test fixture is used as a baseline for running tests to ensure that there is a fixed environment in which tests are run so that results are repeatable.

Examples :

creating temporary databases.
starting a server process.

***. test case:***

A test case is a set of conditions which is used to determine whether a system under test works correctly.

***. test suite:***

Test suite is a collection of testcases that are used to test a software program to show that it has some specified set of behaviours by executing the aggregated tests together.

***. test runner:***

A test runner is a component which set up the execution of tests and provides the outcome to the user.

***Basic Test Structure :***

unittest defines tests by the following two ways :

- Manage test “fixtures” using code.
- test itself.
