    "***What is Unit Testing?*** \n",
    "\n",
    "Unit Testing is the first level of software testing where the smallest testable parts of a software are tested. This is used to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed.\n",
    "The unittest test framework is python’s xUnit style framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Method:***\n",
    "\n",
    "White Box Testing method is used for Unit testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "***OOP concepts supported by unittest framework:***\n",
    "\n",
    "***. test fixture:***\n",
    "\n",
    "A test fixture is used as a baseline for running tests to ensure that there is a fixed environment in which tests are run so that results are repeatable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples :\n",
    "\n",
    "creating temporary databases.\n",
    "starting a server process.\n",
    "\n",
    "***. test case:***\n",
    "\n",
    "A test case is a set of conditions which is used to determine whether a system under test works correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "***. test suite:***\n",
    "\n",
    "Test suite is a collection of testcases that are used to test a software program to show that it has some specified set of behaviours by executing the aggregated tests together.\n",
    "\n",
    "***. test runner:***\n",
    "\n",
    "A test runner is a component which set up the execution of tests and provides the outcome to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Basic Test Structure :***\n",
    "\n",
    "unittest defines tests by the following two ways :\n",
